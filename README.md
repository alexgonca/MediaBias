Media Omission Bias
===================

Ongoing study with my colleagues Mitra Akhtari (Harvard) and [Julia Cag√©](https://sites.google.com/site/juliacagehomepage/) (Sciences Po) on media omission bias.

There are several studies on media bias as a consequence of media slant. We want to investigate media bias that stems from the silence around certain topics or pieces of news.

We are going to use [Media Cloud](http://www.mediacloud.org/) and [LexisNexis](http://www.lexisnexis.com) as primary data sources and [topic modeling](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/topicmodeling.html) to identify differences in media coverage.
