Media Omission Bias
===================

Ongoing study with my colleagues Mitra Akhtari (Harvard) and [Julia Cag√©](https://sites.google.com/site/juliacagehomepage/) (Sciences Po) on media omission bias.

There are several studies on media bias as a consequence of media slant. We want to investigate media bias that stems from the silence around certain topics or pieces of news.

We are going to use Media Cloud and LexisNexis as primary data sources and topic modeling to identify differences in media coverage.
